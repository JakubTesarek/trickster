# Cookbook
This section presents some common usecases for Trickster and some ideas, how to solve them.

Trickster is written is Python, therefore all examples are written in Python using [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/). Of course you may use any other language you want. Trickster is a REST API service, therefore it's agnostic of the language you use.

## Setup
All examples assume you have Trickster running on `http://localhost:8080`. Check the [installation guide](/trickster/installation.html), if you haven't already, on instruction how to install and start Trickster.
